# We need a specfile to build the RPM package.
# But instead of storing it in this repository,
# we use the one that exists already in src.fedoraproject.org/rpms/golang.
# In particular, we use the specfile from the branch `eln`.
# We'll create the temporary folder .packit_rpm to store the content of the
# Fedora repository.

# We need to tell Packit which files to sync from the upstream repository.
